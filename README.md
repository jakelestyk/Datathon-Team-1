Here is our github repository. We mainly used MySQL for coding and Tableau for visualization. 

Our Process:
1. Created a SQL Database on lmu.build
2. Imported the 2023 EPA data using phpmyADMIN
3. Used MySQL to create relevant queries
4. Shared Queries and files using a shared Microsoft Box folder
5. Made visualizations on queries using Tableau
6. Created presentations based on visualizations and insights, and added our reccomendations for minority groups, women owned businesses, and small businesses
